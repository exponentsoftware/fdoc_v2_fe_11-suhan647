## Audio/Video Streaming Platform App Challenge

### Release 1: Basic Functionality

1. Design the user interface:
   - Create a `Home` component that displays featured audio/video content, categories, and search functionality.
   - Include sections for browsing popular content, recently added content, and user playlists.
   - Implement a navigation bar component to switch between different views.

2. Implement content listing functionality:
   - Create a `ContentList` component that renders a list of audio or video content.
   - Display content details such as title, description, thumbnail, and duration.
   - Use mock data or a media API to fetch and populate the content list.

3. Implement content playback functionality:
   - Create a `MediaPlayer` component that allows users to play audio or video content.
   - Include playback controls like play, pause, seek, volume, and fullscreen.
   - Use a media player library like React Player or Video.js for handling the playback.

### Release 2: User Management and Playlists

1. Implement user authentication and registration:
   - Create user authentication components, including login and registration forms.
   - Handle user authentication and session management using a mock authentication API or library.

2. User playlist management:
   - Create a `Playlist` component that allows users to create and manage their playlists.
   - Implement features like adding content to a playlist, removing content, and playlist renaming.
   - Store user playlists and their content in the application state or a separate data source.

### Release 3: Recommendations and Social Features

1. Implement content recommendations:
   - Create a recommendation engine that suggests relevant audio or video content based on user preferences, viewing history, or playlist content.
   - Display recommended content in the `Home` component or a dedicated recommendations section.
   - Update recommendations dynamically as the user interacts with the app.

2. Social features:
   - Enable users to like, comment on, and share audio or video content.
   - Implement features like content rating, user reviews, and user-generated playlists.
   - Include options for users to follow other users, view their activity, and discover content based on user recommendations.

Guidelines:
- Use React functional components and hooks for building the user interface and managing state.
- Utilize React Router for navigation between different views, such as the `Home`, `ContentList`, and `MediaPlayer` components.
- Store media content, user playlists, and recommendations in a state management tool like Redux or the React Context API.
- Consider using a media streaming library like React Player or Video.js for handling media playback.
- Provide clear instructions on how to run the application and any necessary setup steps in the documentation.
